## Ok, so we figured that out

```markdown
If I type three``` and then type markdown with no spaces after it I can create a syntax highlighted code block.


Ok, but I can't forget the three``` at the end to enclose the highlighted area.  And it should be noted that 
even just typing the three``` to explain myself has done something as well.  Can't escape it for some reason.
```

### Markdown

2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

### Jekyll Themes

My Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme I have selected in my [repository settings](https://github.com/hikatebaker/hikatebaker.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### So, What do you think, Shad?

It's a good starting point for learning I think!
